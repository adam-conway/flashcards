<h1>Flashcards</h1>
<p>This project lets you load a txt file of questions and answers. After you've
loaded the questions and answers, you can play a command line game asking the
user to answer questions. At the end, the user will find out how well they did.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>You'll need to make sure lib/cards.txt has the questions you'd like to ask and
the associated answers in the format <code>question,answer</code>.
Once that's loaded, run lib/flashcard_runner.rb in the command line. You can either
pass the location of your questions (cards.txt) as a command line argument, or
the file will ask for the location of the questions.
